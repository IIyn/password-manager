# Password Manager

## How does it work ?

The purpose is to easily store and retrieve passwords. The passwords are stored in a file encrypted with a master password. The master password is never stored anywhere, so it is important to remember it. The master password is used to encrypt and decrypt the passwords file. You can edit your passwords and also the master password.

You call the program by specifying which password you want to get. The program will ask you for the master password and then will copy the password to the clipboard. You can then paste it wherever you want.
